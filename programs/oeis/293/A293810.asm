; A293810 o=1: The truncated kernel function of n: the product of distinct primes dividing n, but excluding the largest prime divisor of n. 
; Coded manually 2021-02-25 by Antti Karttunen, https://github.com/karttu
; Essentially implementing A007947 without taking its largest prime divisor into the product
; Note that A293810(n) = A007947(n)/A006530(n).

add $0,1 ; Add one, because A293810 is offset=1 sequence.
mov $1,1 ; Initialize the result-register, eventually a product of dividing primes
mov $2,2 ; Will contain candidates for successive numbers (primes) that will divide what's remaining of n, after all earlier divisors have been divided out.
mov $3,$0 ; Make a copy of an argument, for later use as a loop counter (outer loop)
mov $4,$3 ; also another copy (for the inner loop)
lpb $3
  mov $5,$4 ; Get a fresh copy of orig n for the the inner loop counter
  mov $6,0 ; will be valuation(n,$2)
  lpb $5
    add $6,1
    mov $7,$0
    mod $7,$2 ; Does our prime candidate divide what is remaining of n?
    div $0,$2 ; Divide it really (the last iteration is discarded, so $0 is not corrupted as $0 = floor($0/$2) when $2 does not divide $0)
    cmp $7,0 ; now $7 = 1 if $2 really did divide, 0 if not.
    sub $5,$7 ; Thus we will fall out of this inner loop when all instances of $2 has been divided out of $0.
  lpe
  cmp $6,0
  cmp $6,0
  mov $7,$2
  pow $7,$6 ; Now $7 = either $2^1 = $2 or $2^0 = 1 depending on whether $2 is a divisor or n.
  mul $1,$7 ; Update the product, with one instance of each prime-divisor
  add $2,1 ; Obtain the next divisor candidate of n
  mov $7,$0 ; Check whether $0 has reached one...
  cmp $7,1
  cmp $7,0
  sub $3,$7 ; then either decrement the loop counter by one, or fall out if $0 has reached one.
lpe
mov $0,$1
