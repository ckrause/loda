; A057032: Let P(n) of a sequence s(1), s(2), s(3), ... be obtained by leaving s(1), ..., s(n-1) fixed and forward-cyclically permuting every n consecutive terms thereafter; apply P(2) to 1, 2, 3, ... to get PS(2), then apply P(3) to PS(2) to get PS(3), then apply P(4) to PS(3), etc. The limit of PS(n) as n -> oo is this sequence.
