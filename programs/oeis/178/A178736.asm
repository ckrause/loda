mov $5,$0
mul $5,10
; Now $5 holds 10*n
; Determine the number of times to loop
mov $2,$5
seq $2,70939 ; Length of binary representation of 10*n.
mov $4,1 ; Inital scale factor
lpb $2
  ; Do xor with the lowest bit
  mov $3,$0
  add $3,$5
  mod $3,2
  ; Now $3 holds the bitwise xor with $0 and $5
  ; Scale up the bit, and add to result
  mul $3,$4
  add $1,$3
  div $0,2 ; Remove the lowest bit from n
  div $5,2 ; Remove the lowest bit from 10*n
  mul $4,2 ; Double the scale factor. Example: 1,2,4,8,16,32
  sub $2,1
