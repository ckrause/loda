; A141214: Defining A to be the interior angle of a regular polygon, the number of constructible regular polygons such that A is in a field extension <= degree 2^n, starting with n=0. This is also the number of values of x such that phi(x)/2 is a power of 2 <= 2^n (where phi is Euler's phi function), also starting with n=0.
