; A182878: Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of lattice paths L_n of weight n having length k (0 <= k <= n). These are paths that start at (0,0) and end on the horizontal axis and whose steps are of the following four kinds: a (1,0)-step with weight 1, a (1,0)-step with weight 2, a (1,1)-step with weight 2, and a (1,-1)-step with weight 1.
