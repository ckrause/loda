; A073612: Group the positive integers as (1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8, 9, 10), (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17), ... the n-th group containing prime(n) elements. Except the first, all groups contain an odd number of elements and hence have a middle term. Sequence gives the middle terms starting from group 2.
