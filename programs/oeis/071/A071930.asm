; A071930: Number of words of length 2n in the two letters s and t that reduce to the identity 1 by using the relations ssTT=1, ststSS=1 and ststTT=1, where S and T are the inverses of s and t, respectively (i.e., sS=1 and tT=1). The generators s and t and the three stated relations generate the quaternion group Q4.
