; A064989 o=1: Multiplicative with a(2^e) = 1 and a(p^e) = prevprime(p)^e for odd primes p.

; Note that A064989(n) <= n, and in this version also all the intermediate results also are <= n,
; which means that if n is in the valid (positive?) range of the LODA-machine, then a(n) should also be.
; A few derived sequences: A064216(n) = A064989(2n-1), A108951(n) = n * A108951(A064989(n)).
; Also A252463(n) = n/2 if n is even, A252463(n) = A064989(n) if n is odd.

add $0,1 ; Add one, because A064989 is offset=1 sequence.

  mul $1,$4 ; Multiply m by ($2-1) of the previous iteration (and by 1 on the first iteration).
  mov $3,$0 ; What's remaining of $0 is safe upper limit for finding its smallest prime factor.
